# SCDRHA
SCDRHA: A scRNA-seq data Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm based on Hierarchical Autoencoder
In order to implement SCDRHA, denoising must be carried out first, and then the graph autoencoder is followed. It should be noted that the denoising is based on tensorflow-1.0, while the graph autoencoder is based on tensorflow-2.0.
